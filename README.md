# Project: Healthcare Insurance Cost Analysis

This is a comprehensive data analysis tool designed to streamline data exploration, analysis, and visualisation. The tool supports multiple data formats and provides an intuitive interface for both novice and expert data scientists.

## Dataset Content

-   The dataset contains information on the relationship between personal attributes (age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits) and geographic factors, and their impact on medical insurance charges.

## Business Requirements

-   Analyse healthcare insurance data to understand how personal attributes and geographic factors influence insurance costs.
-   Provide insights for estimating healthcare insurance charges based on personal and geographic attributes.

## Hypothesis

-   Descriptive Statistics: Display basic statistics such as average insurance charges by age, gender, and region.
-   Correlation Analysis: Visualise correlations between different attributes and insurance charges.
-   Geographic Analysis: Visualise the impact of geographic regions on insurance charges.

## Project Plan

-   Set up new repository and project board on GitHub https://github.com/users/BethW83/projects/2
-   Get the data from Kaggle
-   Clean the data
-   Transform the data
-   Visualisations
-   Regularly commit to GitHub
-   Document clearly and concisely

## Analysis techniques used

-   Descriptive Statistics:
-   Correlation Analysis:
-   Geographic Analysis:

-   List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
-   How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
-   Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
-   How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Conclusion

## Reflection

## Ethical considerations

-   The data is available publically on Kaggle
-   Provenance: "my method the collect is conversation with peoples in hospital and too see datas online the hospistal about insegurance for world with my dataset creation visualization with peoples development method."
-   There is no information present in the data that could identify a person specifically

## Dashboard Design

-   List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
-   Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).
-   How were data insights communicated to technical and non-technical audiences?
-   Explain how the dashboard was designed to communicate complex data insights to different audiences.

## Unfixed Bugs

-   Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
-   Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
-   If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap

-   What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
-   What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience?
-   Ongoing challenge of getting used to a new laptop and to Windows (for many years I have used Linux)
-   Initial error message in VSCode, easily remedied by installing the ipnykernel package and restarting VSCode
